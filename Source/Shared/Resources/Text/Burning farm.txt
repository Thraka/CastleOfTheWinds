You gaze once more at the charred ruins of the farm where you were raised.  You buried the blackened skeletons of your godparents in the remains of the garden they loved; but you can't bury the anger which still seethes at the thought of how they died.  Grimly, you vow that nothing will prevent you from avenging their deaths.

The marauders pillaged the farm quite thoroughly.  Nowhere in the ruins can you find the amulet left for you by your true father, whose dying words, whispered to your godfather, were supposedly of its importance to you: of how it could lead you to your fortune and great glory, but only if you proved your worth.  Your godparents had promised it to you for your 18th birthday; now you have neither godparents nor birthright, and your birthday has just passed.

A search for clues in the rubble finds only a confused trail of footprints, leading north, towards the mountains.  Many of the footprints seem much too large to have come from the boots of bandits or soldiers.

You look north, wondering: Where might the amulet be by now? To whom must you prove yourself, and how?
