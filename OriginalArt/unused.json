  "#You examine the scrap of paper carefully, which turns\r\nout to be part of a message in a strange blood red script. \r\nThe top part is missing, but you can make out the following:\r\n\r\n          ...is dead, return to the fortress north of Bjarnarhaven and\r\n\r\n          await my orders.  I repeat, stop at NOTHING to ensure this\r\n\r\n          danger is removed!\r\n\r\nIt is signed at the bottom with a single ornate 'S', with\r\nflames entwining the letter.  As you stare at the flames\r\nthey seem to flicker and dance, and you feel the paper grow\r\nhot in your hands.  You hurriedly drop it as the paper bursts\r\ninto flames, and you watch in shock as the ashes fall to the\r\nground.  Your stomach feels a bit queasy with worry,\r\nand you think maybe you should head back to the hamlet.\r\n\r\n#",
  "#You are almost home.  Ahead of you, the path winds another half\r\nmile around the hills north of the hamlet.  Your pack rests heavily\r\non your shoulders, shifting slightly with each step you take.  The\r\nenigmas of the mine still nag at you: why were those fell creatures\r\nencamped therein?  From where did they come?  And what was the meaning\r\nof the scrap of parchment you recovered at the bottom?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you round the last hill, a sharp smoky smell fills your nostrils.\r\nBurning thatch?  Hastily, you drop your pack and jog to the wrecked\r\ngate.  Heavy smoke hangs in the air; charred timbers still smolder from\r\nthe ruins of houses.  The air lies eerily quiet, missing the babble\r\nof a living hamlet: the cries of children, the cackle of poultry.  A\r\nwrecked wagon lies, overturned, in the middle of the road.  Two vultures\r\nstart at your intrusion, and flap away heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith horror, you suddenly understand part of the message fragment you\r\nfound in the mine:\r\n\r\n          ...is dead, return to the fortress north of Bjarnarhaven and\r\n\r\n          wait my orders.  I repeat: stop at nothing to ensure that\r\n\r\n          this danger is removed!\r\n\r\n\r\n#",
  "#This was no random act of destruction, and neither was the burning of\r\nyour farm.  Somebody ordered this, somebody who saw danger in this\r\nhumble hamlet... or in its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShocked, you realize that this savage act must have been aimed at you.\r\nNone of these villagers had traveled more than a league from home in\r\ntheir entire lives.  You were not born here, but far away; you lost\r\nyour godparents in a similar horrific act of arson.  You must be the\r\ndanger!  You wonder again at your unknown past, which again has proven\r\ndeadly to those you loved; and you swear once again to exact vengeance\r\nagainst those responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more you ponder the scrap of parchment.  The town of Bjarnarhaven lies\r\nbut a day's journey down the highway to the west; perhaps you should\r\nexercise your growing skills against this \"fortress.\"  You kick aside a\r\npiece of broken gate, then, remembering your dropped pack, head back up\r\nthe path to recover it.  Bjarnarhaven awaits you.\r\n\r\n#",
  "#You uncrumple and carefully examine the scrap of parchment,\r\nfinding it covered with crude handwriting in a dark \r\nreddish-brown ink.  Laboriously, you decipher the writing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Take a Squad of Goblin Warriorf & patrol ye upper\r\n\r\n          Levelf of ye Fortrefs carefully.  There be Signf of an\r\n\r\n          Intruder within ye Dunjon; & HRUNGNIR fearf we may have\r\n\r\n          mifsed our Quarry.  As HRUNGNIR haf already carried hif\r\n\r\n          Tale of Succefs back to ye Caftle, we muft labor to\r\n\r\n          bring the Ring of Truth to hif Word; elfe the leaping\r\n\r\n          Flames will claim uf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Should ye find human Men or Women lyrking about, slay\r\n\r\n          them without Delay; & bring uf the stilled Bodief.\r\n\r\n          Loot not their Corpfes! or elfe tafte the leaping Flames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terse note prompts more questions than it answers:  Who\r\nis this Hrungnir?  And what castle is this mentioned, to\r\nwhich Hrungnir reports?  Somebody ordered a dragnet;\r\nuneasily, you suspect that you were the target, just as you\r\nwere the target of your village's arson.  Who is\r\nmasterminding this search?\r\n\r\nGrimly, you laugh as you shred the note: at least this\r\npatrol will now never loot against orders.\r\n\r\n#",
  "#As you examine the contents of the bandit's chests, you\r\nrealize with a shock that some of what is here came from your\r\nfarm and village!  You recognize cloths and merchandise\r\nfrom the general store, and even a battered shield that hung\r\nover the blacksmith's forge!  You root through the chests,\r\nhoping against hope that your father's amulet is there, but\r\nare disappointed.\r\n\r\nYou know for sure, however, that you are on the right track.\r\nThese marauders you defeated must surely have been responsible\r\nfor torching your home, and you feel a savage joy at repaying\r\nthem in kind.  You aren't done yet, you know, for there is still\r\nthis Hrungnir to deal with, but his time of reckoning is fast\r\napproaching!\r\n\r\n#",
  "#Before you looms a gigantic figure out of legend.  Long ago\r\nin a more peaceful time, your godparents spun tales of the\r\nNine Worlds around you: the worlds of the Aesir and Vanir\r\ngods above; the world of the dead and the dark dwarfs below;\r\nand grim worlds of frost and flame and stone through which\r\nstride the mighty Jotuns, called Giants in those rare times\r\nwhen they walk the Earth.  The enormous being before you can\r\nonly be such a Jotun: taller and broader than any man, or\r\neven any ogre, yet equipped and accoutered in a manner which\r\nsuggests intelligence much beyond any mere monster.\r\n\r\nEyes which gleam with evil meet your gaze.  The giant rubs\r\nhis broad chin and shouts in a gravelly bass:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         Who is the impertinent human who would visit great\r\n\r\n         Hrungnir with a weapon drawn?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last!  You confront the one who destroyed your foster\r\nparents' farm, who burned and pillaged the simple hamlet\r\nwhich sheltered you, who in his pursuit of you has\r\nslaughtered all you held dear.  \r\n\r\n#",
  "#Hrungnir notes your mounting rage and chuckles:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         Ah.  So you are the one I was to kill, the little\r\n\r\n         creature who caused such a disturbance in the upper\r\n\r\n         fortress... I suspected that those villagers were too\r\n\r\n         meek to have been the threat I sought.  How kind of you\r\n\r\n         now to come to me so that I may finish the task properly.\r\n\r\n         My lord need never know of my initial failure.\r\n\r\n         Guards!  Destroy this foolish pest!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn imperious gesture from Hrungnir summons a squad of armored ogres. \r\nAs they rush at you, the giant hefts a round boulder in one hand.\r\n#",
  "#Hrungnir grimaces in annoyance, and with a quick gesture\r\nwards your spell, which shatters into coruscating sparks.\r\nHe smirks and growls,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          So the little hero is a mage as well.  How clever.\r\n\r\n          Spare yourself the effort of your tiny human spells; I\r\n\r\n          had tasted enchantments which would boil your blood\r\n\r\n          before your father's father ever knew life.  And my\r\n\r\n          club crushes wizards and warriors alike!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou redouble your efforts in the face of the giant's pompous\r\nlaughter.\r\n#",
  "#The mortally wounded Hrungnir staggers and falls to one\r\nknee, descending to your eye level.  One huge hand points at\r\nyou; you brace for a counterspell as the giant traces a\r\nserpentine pattern with a carmine glowing finger, hissing\r\nsibilantly.  Suddenly Hrungnir coughs and chokes, and the\r\nspell flickers out prematurely.  He gasps and meets your\r\ngaze again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          My lord... thinks that you... dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA short bark of giantish laughter dies into a rattle as\r\nHrungnir's eyes glaze, and he pitches over, dead. \r\nVengeance is yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith patience and courage worthy of the great Aesir, you\r\nhave wrought revenge for yourself, your foster parents, and\r\nyour village.  All the pain of the recent weeks came from\r\nthe designs of the enormous being Hrungnir; now his body\r\nlies dead before you.  His depredations have come to an end. \r\nBut who sent this Hrungnir?  To whom or what did he report? \r\nWhy were you selected to receive his malign attentions?\r\n\r\n#",
  "#These questions haunt you as, impelled by a nagging\r\nsuspicion, you search the battered body of the dead giant. \r\nA familiar glint from under the giant's jerkin stops your\r\nbreath momentarily.  There!  With trembling hands you draw\r\nforth a shining amulet, which warms immediately to your\r\ntouch.  Left for you by your dead and unknown father, kept\r\nin trust for you by your slain foster parents, stolen by\r\nHrungnir's brigands, now recovered by your heroism: you now\r\nhold in your hands the promised legacy, the key to your\r\nunknown birthright.  It seems to glow faintly in greeting,\r\nand grows unnaturally warm as you think of your father. \r\nWithout hesitation you place the amulet around your neck,\r\nwhere it fits you perfectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n#",
  "#Upon activating the amulet, you immediately feel it radiate power.  As its\r\naura spreads, enveloping you, your awareness of the world around you fades.\r\nA warm, colorless glow obscures your vision; a watery rushing sound fills\r\nyour ears; you can no longer feel the weight of your armor, or even your\r\nfeet on the ground, as if you were floating in a warm pool.  The rushing\r\nsound fades to a low burble, and then to a barely noticeable throb.  You feel\r\nwarm, and protected, and somehow content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTime passes.  A minute?  An hour?  You don't know.  After an unknown time,\r\nyou notice a shape in the glow before you; as you watch, it coalesces into\r\nthe form of a man in shimmering ornate armor, who meets your gaze and smiles\r\nwarmly.  His features seem familiar, though you don't recognize his face.\r\nHe opens his mouth to speak, and the low throb in your ears rises rapidly in\r\npitch until it forms words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         My %x, I am he who was called Prince Arvi, thy father.  The power of the\r\n\r\n         amulet which thou now dost wear has summoned me from the nether realm,\r\n\r\n         and thee from Midgard, so that I may speak to thee this once.  Thou hast\r\n\r\n         done very well to have come this far against all the obstacles before thee,\r\n\r\n         and I am well pleased with the manner in which thou hast shown thy mettle,\r\n\r\n         avenging the deaths of thine godparents and the destruction of thy village.\r\n\r\n         Yet thy greatest test still awaits thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#",
  "#Elation fills you at your father's words of praise, and the discovery of\r\nyour royal blood; but his hint of future trials tempers your delight with\r\nforeboding.  Your father continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         Eighteen winters ago, disaster struck our line, when we became enmeshed in\r\n\r\n         a great conflict between the Aesir Thor and trickster Loki.  On mortal Midgard,\r\n\r\n         dread Surtur himself has taken a part, which was not to happen until the eve\r\n\r\n         of Ragnarok; all the wise in all the nine worlds fear that his continuing\r\n\r\n         intervention in mortal affairs portends the premature arrival of Ragnarok, and\r\n\r\n         doom for us all.  The attacks on thy farm and village, terrible as they were, are\r\n\r\n         then but two threads in this great pattern; for Hrungnir hunted thee at the direct\r\n\r\n         command of Surtur, who sees that thou art fated to oppose him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         It is thy task, then, as the last surviving heir to the throne, and thy fated\r\n\r\n         destiny, as my %x, to thwart Surtur's designs on Midgard.  Thou must\r\n\r\n         reclaim our fallen Castle of the Winds!\r\n#",
  "#         When thou dost invoke the power of thy amulet once more, it will transport\r\n\r\n         thee to a town near the Castle.  From there, wend thy way to the Castle's\r\n\r\n         ruined throne room, where even now the shade of my father, King Lifthransir,\r\n\r\n         thy grandfather, awaits thy arrival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou notice your father's voice slur somewhat, dropping a bit in pitch, and\r\nhis mailed legs waver as if seen through a fire.  He looks away for a\r\nmoment, then meets your gaze again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         I may tarry here no longer, but must leave thee now to fulfill thy destiny and \r\n\r\n         so lift the doom on our bloodline.  Thy grandfather can tell thee more.  May all\r\n\r\n         the Aesir shield thee, dear %x.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a final gentle smile, your father's image dissolves into the\r\nsurrounding glow, and a low rumble replaces his voice in your ears,\r\nleaving you alone, once again fatherless.  The glow reveals no other\r\nfigures, yields no other voices.  You float without sense of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter an indeterminable period, awareness of your surroundings returns.\r\nYou find yourself back on your feet, with the Amulet cooling in your hand,\r\nand a hundred questions heating your mind.\r\n\r\n#",
  "#Here ends Part One of Castle of the Winds, \"A Question of\r\nVengeance\".  To continue your adventures in Part Two, \"The\r\nFall of Surtur\", save your game now and see Order Information\r\nunder the help menu.

  "#As you activate the amulet a second time, you feel it begin\r\nto glow once more with occult power.  The aura surrounds you, \r\nbut this time the feeling is different.  You look at the\r\namulet in your hands and realize that your body is becoming\r\ntransparent, as if losing contact with the material plane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the world about you fades, you get a sense of weightlessness\r\nfollowed by massive acceleration, as if you were covering\r\nhundreds of leagues in but an instant. You feel the blood\r\npounding in your veins as the sensation of speed stops as\r\nsuddenly as it began.  Your head spins for a moment, and\r\nwhen you regain your balance you find your body is solid\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou open your eyes and find yourself in the middle of a small\r\ncity.  To the west is the central keep of the city, to the east\r\nyou see an avenue of shops. To the south you see fountains\r\nand the familiar shape of the Temple of Odin.  You turn about,\r\ntaking a moment to orient yourself, until at last you look to\r\nthe north.  You gasp in awe as you see at last the massive ruins\r\nof the Castle of the Winds, where the shade of your grandfather\r\nawaits your arrival.  But first, you think, maybe you'll stop\r\nin at the and speak to the Jarl, he may be able to help you.\r\n\r\n#",
  "#As you attempt to enter the keep, a burly guard stops you\r\nand demands your identity.  You briefly consider concocting\r\nsome story, but decide to tell the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \"I'm King Lifthransir's grandchild, and I would like\r\n\r\n         to speak to the Jarl.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour face goes red as the guard bursts out laughing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \"Ha! Another one! Sorry youngster, but the Jarl doesn't\r\n\r\n         have time to talk to every pretender to the throne.  He's\r\n\r\n         busy enough trying to handle the creatures that sneak out \r\n\r\n         and kidnap peasants.  Do something about them and maybe\r\n\r\n         he'll talk to you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnoyed and frustrated you turn and leave, but you know you'll\r\ncome back soon and make him eat his words.\r\n\r\n#",
  "#The shade of King Lifthransir speaks to you:\r\n\r\nAt last, my child, thou hast come to avenge me!  For eighteen long years\r\nhave I awaited thy coming.  Thy father hast told thee some of our\r\nfamily's doom.  How I rue the day I listened to Loki's words.  \"A helm of\r\ngreat power,\" he promised me, one that \"would make the wind and storm do\r\nmy bidding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle did he mention that the helm was STOLEN!  Aye my child, from the\r\ntreasure room of mighty Thor himself!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNor did he mention that Surtur, the demon Lord of Fiery Muspelheim, coveted\r\nthe helm for himself, and would league with the giants against me!  Soon\r\nafter I received the helm, and long before I had mastered its use, an\r\narmy of giants invaded this, our mountain home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey came from the mountains around us, and even from the caverns below! \r\nHill Giants, rough as the mountain wilds, Stone Giants, strong as the\r\nrocks they are named for, Frost Giants, children of Ancient Ymir, and\r\nthe Fire Giants, those closest to Surtur himself.  They came, led by\r\ntheir Kings, and with them came devils from Muspelheim.  Even now they\r\nroam the lower depths, so beware their might!\r\n#",
  "#For a day and a night the battle raged, and many heroes fell before\r\nthe onslaught of Surtur's hell-spawned minions.  At last we could\r\nhold out no longer, and the final barricades were breached.  The last\r\nfew survivors gathered here in the throne room to await their doom. \r\nSome despaired and took their own lives, rather than submit to the\r\nwhims of the victors, but most prepared to fight to the last. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA troop of fire giants marched into this great hall, followed by two of\r\nthe abyss devils that served as Surtur's captains.  Then the hall became\r\nbrighter, as if a small sun were moving up the corridor towards us,\r\nand a glowing figure wielding a flaming sword entered.  It was dread\r\nSurtur himself who approached my throne, and demanded the Helm of Storms. \r\nI cursed his name and declared that while he might take my life, and\r\nthe Helm as well, one of my line would return to banish him from Midgard. \r\nAnd so it was, for he slew me with his sword of fire, took the Helm, and\r\ndoomed me to roam Midgard as a spirit for as long as he remained!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany are the challenges that face thee, ere thou recoverest the Helm of\r\nStorms, and returnest it to Thor.  But recover it thou must, lest the\r\nevil of Surtur and his giant minions gains a permanent hold on Midgard,\r\nand Ragnarok comes early!  I have removed the wall of force that blocks\r\nentry to the dungeon.  Go now, and avenge the wrongs done thy family!\r\n\r\n\r\n#",
  "#The shade of King Lifthransir speaks again:\r\n\r\nI see thou hast not yet been successful in thy quest.  I must warn\r\nthee that time is of the essence.  I can sense a mighty force tampering\r\nwith the elements, and I fear that Surtur has finally begun to master\r\nthe Helm.  Every day that Surtur is given, he will gain more power\r\nover the wind and weather.  If left too long, he will gain mastery of\r\nlightning and storm, as well as his power over fire, and will be close\r\nto invincible!\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly thou canst prevent Surtur from ruling all of Midgard!  Return to thy\r\nquest, and may the Aesir shield thee from harm!\r\n\r\n#",
  "#The prisoner speaks to you:\r\n\r\n\"A thousand thanks noble one!  I was a simple farmer tilling the\r\nfields outside of town, until a pillaging band of goblins raided\r\nour farm and dragged me off.  I've been captive for weeks now,\r\ntraded down from level to level, deeper into the dungeon.  Had\r\nyou not come when you did, though, I fear I would be dead, sacrificed\r\nto Surtur the fire demon!  A giant emissary was here a day ago, and\r\nsaid Surtur demanded an offering.  His hatred for mankind is strong, and\r\nI fear for all people if he should come to rule Midgard!\r\n\r\nA word of warning then, and a piece of knowledge to help your quest,\r\nas thanks for rescuing me.  As lord of sulfurous Muspelheim, Surtur\r\nis immune to heat and flame.  His greatest fear is the attack of\r\nmighty Thor, the Thunder God, and the lightning bolts Thor calls down\r\nfrom the heavens.\r\n\r\nGood luck! With care, I should be able to make my way back to the\r\nsurface, so fare thee well!\"\r\n\r\nYou see the prisoner limp off, looking warily around as he goes...\r\n\r\n#",
  "#News of your rescue of the prisoner has reached the keep\r\nbefore you, for the story of the man's joyous homecoming\r\nspread like wildfire.  You are quickly escorted to the\r\nJarl's presence by the very guard who had laughed at\r\nyou before.  This time, you are pleased to note, he\r\nshows you a bit more deference!

I can almost believe\r\n\r\n         your story now, but you shall have ample opportunity\r\n\r\n         to prove yourself if you continue your quest.  Here,\r\n\r\n         then, is a purse of a hundred gold pieces to aid\r\n\r\n         your quest, and may the gods go with you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jarl seats himself once more, and you are escorted out. \r\n\"This will be very useful\", you think as you weigh the purse\r\nin your hands.\r\n#",

You are pretty sure of the translation,\r\nand prepare to meet their attack.\r\n\r\n#",
  "#As did the wolf pack above, the bear pack reacts in\r\na concerted and deadly manner to your appearance.  A\r\nfew low growls from the bearman who leads them sends\r\nthe pack on the offensive.

The dungeon below the castle is 25 levels deep,\r\n\r\n         and Surtur is said to have his throne room on the bottom\r\n\r\n         level.  Take these enchanted gauntlets from the city\r\n\r\n         armory as thanks for your aid, and good luck in your quest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are discouraged for a moment at the thought that you are not\r\neven halfway to the bottom, but then you take heart in your progress\r\nso far and prepare to return to the castle.\r\n#",

From the shadows shambling shapes\r\nemerge.  Their hunched figures belie their strength,\r\nand you know all too well the deadly powers these\r\nwights posses.

Below the 15th level the\r\n\r\n         giant kings have their halls, where they hold court with\r\n\r\n         many of their kind.  There are also said to be\r\n\r\n         several places where the walls between the elemental\r\n\r\n         planes and our own have been breached!

Maybe you like to eat rock.\"  His laughter rattles your bones as he\r\nhefts an enormous boulder.\r\n#",

I will deal with you\r\n\r\n         as easily as I dealt with your father and grandfather\r\n\r\n         before you!
