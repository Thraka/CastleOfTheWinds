# Stores

Each store has a different markup.  The markup doesn't appear to be affected by game difficulty.
The amount offered in stores is 40% lower than the value of the item in the save file.  So, there's a 40%
discount on all offer prices, and each store charges a different premium on the asking price.

Stores sell items from 1 or more of 5 categories:

- Weapons
- Armor = armor, helmets, bracers, gauntlets, shields
- Equipment = chests, belts, boots, cloaks, purses,
- Alchemy = spell books, potions, scrolls
- Magic = staffs, wands, rings, amulets
